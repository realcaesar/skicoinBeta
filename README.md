What is Skicoin?
----------------

Skicoin is a merge-minable SHA256 coin which provides an array of useful services
which leverage the bitcoin protocol and blockchain technology.

- 1 minute block targets, diff retarget each block using Dark Gravity Wave(24) 
- Rewards are variable:
  - 10 percent to governance proposals
  - 18/27 percent cycle to masternodes
  - remainder to miner
  - miner and masternode share fees 50:50
- SHA256 Proof of Work
- Mineable either exclusively or via merge-mining any SHA256 PoW coin
- Skicoin data service fees burned
- Masternode collateral requirement: 10500 Skicoins
- Governance proposals payout schedule: every month
- Governance funding per round (89630 Skicoins per month)

Services include:

- Hybrid layer 2 PoW/PoS consensus with bonded validator system (masternodes)
- Decentralized governance (blockchain pays for work via proposals and masternode votes)
- Decentralized identity reservation, ownership, and exchange
- Digital certificate storage, ownership, and exchange
- Distributed marketplace and exchange
- Digital services provider marketplace and platform
- Digital asset creation and management
- Decentralized escrow service

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is meant to be stable. Development is normally done in separate branches.
[Tags](https://github.com/skicoin/skicoin/tags) are created to indicate new official,
stable release versions of Skicoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

Skicoin test suites can run by `cd src/test && ./test_skicoin`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows
and Linux, OS X, and that unit and sanity tests are automatically run.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Skicoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/skicoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
